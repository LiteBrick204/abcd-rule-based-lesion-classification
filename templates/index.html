			  <p>
                  Solar lentigo, also known as "liver spots" or "age spots," is a common benign condition characterized by small, flat, brown or black spots on the skin. They are typically found on areas of skin that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, hands, arms, and shoulders.
                  <br><br> Lentigo NOS can occur on any part of the body and is most commonly found on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, neck, and hands. They are usually harmless and do not require treatment, but can sometimes be confused with melanoma or other types of skin cancer.
                  <br><br> Lichenoid keratosis (LK) is a type of benign skin lesion that appears as a small, flat, or slightly raised area of skin. LK lesions typically range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter and may be pink, red, or brown in color.
                  <br><br> Nevi are usually small, pigmented (colored) spots on the skin that are typically round or oval-shaped. They can range in color from tan to brown to black, and may be flat or raised.
                  <br><br> Seborrheic keratosis appears as a brown, black, or light tan growth on the face, chest, shoulders, or back. It may appear waxy, scaly, or slightly elevated and is typically painless. The growths are typically round or oval-shaped and can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters.
                  <br><br> Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It typically appears as a dark brown or black lesion with an irregular shape and border, although it can also be pink, red, or skin-colored
